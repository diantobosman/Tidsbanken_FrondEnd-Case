## Assignment
Tidsbanken have approached the candidates and requested that a solution for managing
requests for vacation time for their employees. The application serves a dual purpose.
Firstly, it serves to manage the request and approval process of vacation days for employees and ease the burden of communication. Secondly, the application serves to inform employees about each otherâ€™s approved vacation days so that teams may adequately plan for periods of absence.

## How it works
Both the front-end and back-end are uploaded on heroku. This repository is the front-end part of the product. It uses the API-endpoints of the repository below:

[Back-end](https://github.com/savannah-borst/Tidsbanken-case-API)

## How To Use
This repository can be cloned using:

```git clone https://github.com/diantobosman/Tidsbanken_FrontEnd-Case.git```

## Future
Future work may include:

- 2FA-login
- Solving the bug that the calendar has to be reloaded in order to see the vacations
- Use the settings from the created API in the front-end, to create a maximum number of vacation per employee and also to add the constraint of a maximum of contiguous days of vacation.
